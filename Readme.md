# IT Service 2154
It's 2154.

Poverty levels are at an all time high.

Governments are puppets of corporations.

And the people could not be more divided.

But that doesn't really matter. You're an IT guy with a desk-full of customer complaints. Locate their lost files on the web, or else boss won't hesitate to fire you. Again.
